  # Note: Vercel deployments are handled by Vercel's GitHub integration.
  # Vercel is configured to deploy only when the 'test' check passes (required check).
  # - Preview deployments happen automatically on PRs after tests pass
  # - Production deployments happen automatically on main branch after tests pass
