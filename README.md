# Faleproxy

A Node.js web application that fetches a URL, replaces every instance of "Yale" with "Fale" in the document, and displays the modified content.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Fetches web content from any URL
- Replaces all instances of "Yale" with "Fale" (case-insensitive)
- Displays the modified content in an iframe
- Shows original URL and page title in an info bar

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3001`
3. Enter a URL in the input field (e.g., https://www.yale.edu)
4. Click "Fetch & Replace" to see the modified content

## Development

To run with auto-restart on file changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

The application includes a comprehensive test suite:

- **Unit tests**: Test the Yale-to-Fale replacement logic
- **API tests**: Test the application endpoints
- **Integration tests**: Test the entire application workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage for CI/CD
npm run test:ci
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that:

1. Runs on pushes to main/master branches and on pull requests
2. Tests the application on multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x)
3. Generates and uploads test coverage reports
4. Gates deployments: Vercel only deploys when tests pass

### Deployment Strategy

- **Preview Deployments**: Automatically created for pull requests after tests pass
- **Production Deployments**: Automatically deployed to production when merging to main, only if tests pass

### Setting up Vercel Deployment

Deployments are handled by Vercel's GitHub integration:

1. Create a Vercel account and link your repository
2. Create a Vercel project for your application
3. In Vercel project settings, configure:
   - **Git Integration**: Enable "Wait for tests to complete" or set the `test` job as a required check
   - This ensures Vercel only deploys after the GitHub Actions tests pass

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express - Web server framework
- Axios - HTTP client for fetching web pages
- Cheerio - HTML parsing and manipulation
- Vanilla JavaScript for frontend functionality
- Jest, Supertest, and Nock for testing
